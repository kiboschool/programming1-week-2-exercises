Water bills, turning the utility bill rules into conditions and boolean logic

Follow the instructions in the `README` in each of the corresponding subdirectories to

Each exercise's README file contains instructions for testing the individual exercise.
Once you pass all the tests for all the exercises, you are ready to submit to Gradescope.

## Submission
